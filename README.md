# HistoryMark

*Interactive Java app for historical events*


## Introduction


**HistoryMark** is a Java application enabling users to *pin* historical events onto a world-wide, interactive geographic map.


![Example map](https://github.com/giancosta86/HystoryMark/raw/master/screenshots/example.jpg "Interactive map shown by the app")


HistoryMark employs the [Atlas](https://github.com/giancosta86/HystoryMark) library - which, in turn, is based on [JXMapViewer 2](https://github.com/msteiger/jxmapviewer2) and [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org/).


## Running HistoryMark

The suggested way to run HistoryMark is [MoonDeploy](https://github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy), as it will automatically download and launch the application - just go to the [latest release](https://github.com/giancosta86/HistoryMark/releases/latest) page and open the file **App.moondeploy**.

Otherwise, to start the application:
1. Download and decompress the zip archive
2. Run the file *bin/HistoryMark* (on UNIX) or *bin/HistoryMark.bat* (on Windows)


## Online help

HistoryMark features a very user-friendly interface, but ideas and suggestions can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/giancosta86/HistoryMark/wiki)!
