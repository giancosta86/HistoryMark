    Welcome!
</p>

<br/>

<p>
    Navigating the map is as easy as with any other application -
    just employ the mouse (buttons and wheel) and/or the arrow keys.
</p>

<br/>

<p>
    You can also work with <b>pins</b>:
</p>

<br/>

<ul>
    <li>To <b>add</b> a new pin to the map, <i>double click on the map</i></li>

    <li>To <b>edit</b> an existing pin, <i>left-click</i> on it</li>

    <li>To <b>remove</b> a pin, <i>right-click</i> on it</li>
</ul>

<br/>

<p>
    You can filter pins by creating and selecting <b>ages</b> using the toolbar.
</p>

<br/>

<p>
    <i>Your pins and ages are automatically saved to an internal database</i>;
    however, you can <b>export / import</b> <br/>
    both <i>ages</i> and <i>pins</i>, by clicking on the related toolbar buttons.
</p>

<br/>

<p>
